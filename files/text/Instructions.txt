How to play MineSweeper:

There is a 20 x 20 grid which is covered. Underneath there are 40 randomly scattered mines. 

When you left-click on a box, one of three things will happen:
(a) It will be a mine and the game will be over (and you lose)

(b) It will be uncovered and show a number. 
    This number represents the number of mines touching that box (including diagonals).

(c) It will be and empty box (no number or mine) in which case all the touching boxes will be uncovered. 
    If those ones are blank then the process of unocvering will be repeated.
    If the box it uncoveres has a number then that number box will be unocovered but it won't continue to uncover touching boxes. 

If you think a box has a mine then you can right-click it and it will be marked as a different colour (right-click again to change it back)

Game ends when:
(a) You uncover a mine and you lose.

	or

(b) You uncover all the boxes without mines and you win.

Have fun!
